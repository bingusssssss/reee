          Being in your presence feels like a breath of air after a long time beneath the water that revives every part of me. Your voice breaks through the silence like sunlight after the dark. It is like the warmth that seeps in slowly, chasing the cold away.<br><br>Looking into your eyes is like staring into the vastness of the sky filled with stars. Your body is a landscape shaped by nature’s finest hand. It reminds me of mountains, valleys, and rivers - raw, beautiful, and alive.<br><br>When you touch me, it’s like a jolt sparks something deep within me—an electric current running through my veins. I find stillness and motion in your presence all at once, feeling like I am home yet still on the verge of discovery.
